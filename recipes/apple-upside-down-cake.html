    <h1>Apple Upside Down Cake</h1>
    <img src="../images/AppleUpsideDownCake.jpeg" alt="Apple Upside Down Cake">
    <h3>"Is it a pie or a cake? Who knows?"</h3>
    <p>A delicious dessert for fall or winter that combines a cinnamon-spiced cake with buttery caramelized apples. 
        Essentially two desserts in one!

        <h4>Instructions</h4>
        
        <ol>
            <h5>Preheat oven to 350 degress F or 177 degrees C</h5>
            <h5>Preparing the topping</h5>
            <ol>
                <li>Combine butter and brown sugar together in small sauce pan over medium heat</li>
                <li>Whisk occasionally until butter has melted</li>
                <li>Cook, whisking constantly, for 1 minute as mixture thickens</li>
                <li>Remove from heat and whisk in the cinnamon and vanilla extract</li>
                <li>Pour into an ungreased 9x2 inch pie dish or round cake pan (make sure the dish is atleast 2 inches deep)</li>
                <li>Arrange the apple slices neatly on top, overlapping where necessary</li>
                <li>Place pan in the refridgerator for a few minutes as you prepare the cake batter</li>
            </ol>
            <h5>Making the cake</h5>
            <ol>
                <li>Whisk the flour, baking powder, cinnamon, nutmeg, and salt together</li>
                <li>Set this aside</li>
                <li>Using a handheld or stand mixer with a paddle/whisk attachment, beat the butter on high speed until smooth and creamy</li>
                <li>Add both sugars and beat on high speed until creamed together</li>
                <li>Scrap down the sides and up the bottom of the bowl with a rubber spatula as needed</li>
                <li>On high speed, beat in the eggs and vanilla extract until combined</li>
                <li>Scrape down the sides and up the bottom of the bowl as needed</li>
                <li>Pour the dry ingredients into the wet ingredients</li>
                <li>Turn the mixer onto low speed and as the mixer runs, slowly pour in the milk</li>
                <li>Beat on low speed just until all of the ingredients are combined</li>
                <li>Do not over-mix (You may need to whisk it all by hand to make sure there are no lumps)</li>
                <li>Remove topping from the refridgerator</li>
                <li>Pour and spread cake batter evenly over topping</li>
                <li>Bake for 40-46 minutes, tenting foil on top of the cake halfway through bake time to prevent the top from over-browning</li>
                <li>The cake is done when a toothpick inserted into the center of the cake comes out mostly clean</li>
                <li>Remove cake from the oven and cool on a wire rack for just 15 mintues</li>
                <li>Invert the slightly cooled cake onto a cake stand or serving plate</li>
                <li>Some of the juices from the topping will seep over the sides - that's ok</li>
                <li>You can slice and serve the cake warm, but the slices will be messy</li>
                <li>Ideally, letting the cake fully cool gives the best results</li>
                <li>Do not refridgerate the cake to speed up this process</li>
                <li>Cover leftover slices and store for up to 3 days in refridgerator or 3 months in the freezer</li>
            </ol>
